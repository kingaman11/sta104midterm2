Project with partner
For my Sta 104 Class, we have to work together to come up with an project. We are still deciding on what project to start with right now. My partner for this project is Peter Mueller. The states we chose to work on specifically are California, New York City, Florida & Alabama. We wanted to see if there was an statistically significant difference between the 4 groups and so we chose to use the K-group tests in statistics. The K-Group test that we are subject to use is either the Permutation Test or the Kruskal - Wallis Test. We decide after running some diagnostics such as the Levine Test and the Shapiro - Wilks Test that we will be using the Kruskal - Wallis test after noticing that we have outliers in our data as well as an skweded distribution in multiple groups.
